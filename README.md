# Goodlib

Tells you where to borrow books you have saved on your Goodreads `to-read` list.

* Unofficial NLB API based on scraping https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg
  * No ISBN search (requires official NLB API with API key)
  * Search by book title is rather finicky and easily tripped up by missing spaces, differences in phrasing (e.g. w or w/o "the"), etc.
* Unofficial Goodreads API wrapper (with oauth support!)
